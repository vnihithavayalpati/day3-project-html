        <h1><b>Knowledge Management</b></h1>
    <p>The management of knowledge is becoming an important area of interest. However, the question of what constitutes knowledge management may be posed in different ways (Allee, 1997). A traditional meaning approach discusses questions of ownership, control, and value, with an emphasis on planning. Another view is that knowledge is organic, and has a flow, a self-organizing process, and patterns. This latter approach explores how knowledge emerges, and how the patterns change. Also, in an organizational context, what happens to an organization’s knowledge if a knowledgeable and wise employee leaves, and how can an organization manage to capture that. Knowledge is increasingly recognized as an important organizational asset (Iles, 1999). Its creation, dissemination and application are often now seen as a critical source of competitive advantage (Allee, 1997; Lester, 1996)</p>
    <p>Following a tradition supported by Ravetz (1971), Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995, p. 8) distinguish between two types of knowledge: explicit and tacit (Table 2). Tacit knowledge includes cognitive and technical elements. Cognitive elements operate through mental models that are working worldviews that develop through the creation and manipulation of mental analogies. Mental models like schemata, paradigms, perspectives, beliefs and viewpoints, according to Nonaka and Takeuchi, help individuals perceive and define their world. The technical element of tacit knowledge includes concrete know-how, crafts, and skills. However, explicit knowledge is about past events or objects “there and then,” and is seen to be created sequentially by “digital” activity that is theory progressive.</p>
    <p>Nonaka and Takeuchi (Ibid.) develop on this to create what has become perhaps the most well known model for knowledge creation, referred to as the SECI model of knowledge creation and illustrated in Figure 5. It derives from their model of the conversion process between tacit and explicit knowledge, and results in a cycle of knowledge creation. The conversion process involves four processes: socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization, all of which convert between tacit and/or explicit knowledge.</p>

        </aside>
        <img src="img2%20127.png">
        <p>Socialization is the processes by which synthesized knowledge is created through the sharing of experiences that people have as they develop shared mental models and technical skills. Since it is fundamentally experiential, it connects people through their tacit knowledge. Externalization comes next and occurs as tacit knowledge is made explicit. Here, the creation of conceptual knowledge occurs through knowledge articulation, in a communication process that uses language in dialogue and with collective reflection.</p>
        
        <p>The uses of expressions of communication are often inadequate, inconsistent, and insufficient. They leave gaps between images and expression while promoting reflection and interaction. It therefore triggers dialogue. The next process is combination, when explicit knowledge is transformed through its integration by adding, combining and categorizing knowledge. This integration of knowledge is also seen as a systemizing process. Finally, in the next process explicit knowledge is made tacit, by its internalization. This is a learning process, which occurs through the behavioral development of operational knowledge. It uses explicit knowledge like manuals or verbal stories where appropriate.</p>
        <p>The different types of knowledge process are seen as phases in a knowledge creation cycle. This is driven by intention, seen as an aspiration to a set of goals. Autonomy is another requirement that enables the knowledge cycle to be driven. This increases the possibility of motivation to create new knowledge. There are three other conditioning factors. One is the need of fluctuation and creative chaos. This can generate signals of ambiguity and redundancy that inhibits the “improvement” of knowledge. The sharing of redundant information promotes a sharing of tacit knowledge when individuals sense what others are trying to articulate. Finally, requisite variety is needed if an actor is to deal with complexity. Thus, five factors condition the knowledge cycle enabling it to maintain developmental motion.</p>
            <h1><b>A Viable Approach to Knowledge Creation</b></h1>
        <p>The structured spiral of knowledge creation offered by Nonaka and Takeuchi adopts a positivist perspective. An alternative critical approach is possible that links closely with the viable system model of Figure 1. In addressing this, we note that each of the three domains have associated with them its own knowledge process, one connected with cognition, one with organizing, and one with behavior. This notion is consistent with Marshall (1995), whose interest lies in knowledge schema. Schema have four categories: (1) they are the mental organization of individual’s knowledge and experience that allows him/her to recognize experiences that are similar; (2) they access a generic framework that contains the essential elements of all these similar experiences; (3) they use of this framework to plan solutions; and (4) they have the ability to utilize skills and procedures to execute the solution. For this purpose, Marshall identifies three types of knowledge:</p>
        <ul>
    <li>Identification knowledge — the facts and concepts making up the knowledge domain</li>
    <li>Elaboration knowledge — the relationships between the individual knowledge components and the way they are organized</li>
    <li>Execution knowledge — the conceptual skills and procedures required to execute an activity</li>
  </ul>
        <p>Marshall does not attempt to address knowledge creation, though we shall do so through our own model. We consider that in social group situations, knowledge creation occurs through a process of knowledge migration from one worldview to another. It is an identification knowledge process. The basic knowledge management model is as given in Figure 6. It links to Table 1, and depicts the three fundamental phases of the knowledge process: migration, accommodation, and action. Migration is associated with the cognitive domain, accommodation with the organizing domain, and action with the behavioral domain. The way that migration occurs is conditioned by cognitive influence, accommodation though cognitive purpose, and action through cognitive intention. Each phase process has an input and an output. A feedback control process is able to condition each phase process directly, or through its input. The way that each phase process is conditioned by the feedback control is represented symbolically in Figure 6 by a loop around the process bubble, and we shall return to this in a moment.</p>

        <p>The structured spiral of knowledge creation offered by Nonaka and Takeuchi adopts a positivist perspective. An alternative critical approach is possible that links closely with the 3-domain model of Figure 7. In addressing this, we note that each of the three domains have associated with them its own knowledge process, one connected with cognition, one with organizing, and one with behavior. This notion is consistent with that of Marshall (1995) in connection with knowledge schema.</p>

        <p>Marshall applies her ideas on knowledge schema to decision-making by people rather than by social groups. However, a link can be made between them by applying the typology of knowledge to the viable knowledge cycle of Figure 7. We consider that in social group situations, knowledge creation occurs through a process of knowledge migration from one worldview to another, and it is an identification knowledge process. The basic knowledge management model depicts the three fundamental phases of the knowledge process: migration, accommodation, and action. Migration is associated with the existential domain, accommodation with the virtual domain, and action with the behavioral domain. The way that migration occurs is conditioned by cognitive influence, accommodation though cognitive purpose, and action through cognitive interest. Each phase process has an input and an output. A feedback control process is able to condition each phase process directly, or through its input. The way that each phase process is conditioned by the feedback control is represented symbolically by a simple loop around the process bubble.</p>
        <p>Returning now to the control process we referred to earlier, we show the explicit meaning of each return loop in Figure 8.</p>
        <p>Control processes not only condition phase processes. They can also be responsible for re-scheduling them in the overall knowledge cycle. Within perspectives of traditional positivism, it is normal to consider controls in simple terms; but they may also be susceptible to complexity and chaos as illustrated in Table 3 (Yolles, 1999). This has implication for the development of a chaotic activation of a phase that is not sequentially ordered, and that can occur when complexity is affective.</p>
        <p>Control processes, while often considered in terms of positivist or postpositivist paradigms, may also be seen from a critical theory perspective. To do this we invoke the propositions that:</p>
        <p>a. knowledge that enables the nature of a control process to be understood is local and worldview dependent;<p>
